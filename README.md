Code is run by typing "python3 main.py"

Optional ports:

-p or --port sets the arduino serial port id, default value is COM5
-v or --verbose prints more text to the console
-d or --debug prints even more text to the console, used for debugging
-h displays basic help information

Both USB-cables have to be connected to your computer for the program to work (the webcam and the arduino).
Remember to connect the arduino to the power adapter as well.
